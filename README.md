# Arjan Audit

Audit you website's performance and SEO using Lighthouse 6. Often times, when building a site, the page speed test is one of the last things we do. To avoid any surprise surprise, you can use Arjan Audit in your development process or even integrate it into your tests.


## How it works
Arjan audit  uses [express](https://expressjs.com/) to serve your site and google [chrome-launcher](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-launcher) to make a headless launch of google chrome and retrieve the audits from lighthouse 6. Arjan then parses the results returned by Lighthouse and return an organized subset of the results. Also it saves all the audit reports locally by date.  


## Getting Started 
1. install the arjan CLI globally. `npm i -g arjan-cli`
2. inside your proejct direcotry, initialize arja `arjan init`
3. run an audit `arjan audit`


## Programmatic use example
    const Audit = require('arjan-audit')
    Audit('./', 'index.html', 8080, .7)
    .then(data=> console.log(data))
    .catch(err=>console.log(err))
